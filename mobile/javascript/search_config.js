It can translate English to           Legalese. It ultimately changes how lawyers spend their time. The tool takes a plain language           description of a website and then codes that website in ReactJS.       Question-Answering:           GPT-3 made question-answering easy. For the model to perform a Q-A task, it has provided with           pairs of questions and answers from the context.       Cloze tasks:           In cloze tasks, several words have removed and the person has asked to fill the missing content.           Since GPT-3 can predict many words related to the content, GPT-3 made cloze tasks easy.       Unscrambling words:           Restoring a word to an intelligible, readable, or viewable state. For example: Let us take a           scrambled word RELSQUIR where the unscrambled word is SQUIRREL. GPT-3 effortlessly           identifies the unscrambled words.        Reading Conceptual Tasks:           GPT-3 makes conceptual reading a bit           better because GPT-3 can separate           everything related to a concept and makes           the readers understand the topic easily.       Scripting Poems:            GPT-3 can write a whole poem just by the           input of a word. It can also narrate a story           on its own concerning few words. And it           was challenging to distinguish it from a           human-written story.

It uses standardized protocols for its function. It is often referred           to as \"Network of Networks,\" as a consequence of this, communication between people became easy.           Many new technologies arrived for better communication        Mobile Computing and Beyond-2000s:            Mobile phones, PDA (Personal Development Assistance), and Smart Phones are ruling the           contemporary world. They offer a wide range of services to people like multimedia, games, email,           chatting, video conference, GPS, etc.            These days the HCI is employed in the area of Cognitive Science. With the assistance of the Internet,           medical facilities are provided remotely. Different interactive interfaces are drafted, which can be,           used for cognitive rehabilitation.         ROLE OF HUMANS AND COMPUTERS:          HUMANS:            HCI should always consider what users           need and expect, what limitations they           may have, and how their perpetual           systems work. Designers should be           able to make their products attractive           without distracting users from their           tasks. All those above-said things           depend on humans. Here humans are           the users of computers. Therefore           humans should be able to decide what           users find attractive when they use           computers.

It is a newfangled       technology that operates on the principles of quantum physics       unlike the traditional classical computer, which assumes nature       to be discrete.        PRINCIPLE BEHIND QUANTUM COMPUTER       The conventional computer operates on the principle of a Turing             “It is       machine. Any data or instruction is represented as sequences of 0           a quantum       and 1 (known as bits). Similarly, the quantum computer operates       on the principle of a quantum mechanical model of a Turing                  world.       machine, which can have states between 0 and 1 as well (known as            We are       quantum bits or qubits). These states can be achieved by       controlling the spin of an electron or photon. To operate at such           just living       levels, the quantum computer is operated in a cold temperature              in it.”       at around 10mK (millikelvin), by manipulating the state of an       electron or photon.                                                                             -Rodrigue Rizk                  S e p t e m b e r   2 0 2 0                                                                          I s s u e   0 1","The part and parcel features of quantum computing are:         Superposition:             Superposition can be elucidated as a state straddling between 0 and 1. Researchers explain that it is             a state where the qubit coexists in all the possible states at the same instant. It is also a fact that this             paramount feature can transfigure the prevailing cryptography techniques.         Entanglement:             It is the characteristic of quantum bits to exist as doublets. This phenomenon persists even if they             are separated by a distance and is paraphrased as \"Spooky action at a distance\" by Einstein. The             quantum state of both the qubits remains identical all the time, i.e., change in the state of one             quantum bit affects its pair. Hence, we can detect and manipulate the state of one bit by detecting             the state of its corresponding pair.         Decoherence:             Whenever quantum bits interact with surroundings, even subtle changes in the environment alters             the quantum state, making the quantum computer much prone to error. Scientists are             endeavoring to mitigate its effect by maintaining a cold environment. This phenomenon is a             consequence of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle which states that it is impossible to detect two             different quantities (mass and momentum) accurately at the same instant. Hence, whenever we             attempt to detect one property of the quantum state, some other property of the qubit gets             disturbed making the qubit lose its quantum state. The scientists are working hard to overcome             the vulnerability arising on account of any kind of deviation from its normal operating             environment.

This formidable task can be achieved by a quantum computer. It has managed to crack the robust       RSA encryption algorithm (the algorithm which is used to secure a credit card) in a feasible time. This       can be substantiated by the fact that an increase in the computational capacity enhances the possibility       of solving many NP-hard problems in a feasible time. One such instance of problems is the integer       factorization of large integers, which is the foundational concept of RSA encryption. In RSA encryption,       the product of two large prime integers is used as a key. To crack this algorithm, the key needs to be       factorized to get the primes. This problem has been categorized as an NP-hard problem so far. But, the       invention of quantum computing turned the tide. It is expected to crack the primes in less than a day       according to Shor's algorithm. But, not to fret, this threat is at least a couple of decades away as the       supercomputing is still in its budding stage, and of late, it is not being used extensively across the world.       Meanwhile, in due course of time, researchers are also engrossed in the algorithms that can revamp the       prevailing cryptography techniques.       The hopeful prospect of this insurmountable gadget is, it is capable of transforming the existing       security systems as even the most advanced form of the supercomputer cannot match the eminence of       a quantum computer. Researchers are working diligently to strengthen cybersecurity before this       eminent gadget gets into the hands of quantum hackers.        Decoherence also augments to the privacy of the security systems by destroying the quantum state       when an eavesdropper or eve (anyone who is not authorized to have access to the encrypted message)       tries to measure the state of the qubit. Hence, the message sent (by Alice in terms of cryptography) and       received (by Bob in terms of cryptography) tend to mismatch. Whenever there is a mismatch, the bits       are sent over again till they match. And due to superposition, the state of the qubit is equivocal making       the eavesdropper unsure about the message sent.

It mainly       helps in these reasonable scenarios:        • Spamming-Phishing-Spoofing:         This attack depends on the power of attackers to       mislead end users into clicking or download       malicious payloads and subsequently bypassing       internal controls. Machine learning algorithms       learn to spot patterns that reveal malicious       email of the sender by observing email headers       and subsampling of data. With these behaviors,       we can train models to detect if a spamming       attempt has occurred.         • Lateral Movement:         This attack uses different methods to induce access to higher privileges, which allows them to move       between devices and apps through a network. They identify the targets and eventually get cardinal       information.       Machine learning-informed contextualization of this data can give a dynamic view of usual traffic data.       With a clear understanding of typical traffic flow, algorithms can perform change-point detection that       means they'll identify instances when the probability distribution of given itinerary changes and becomes       unlikely supported \"normal\" traffic activity to detect potential threats.         • Covert Channel:        It is an attack used to transfer information illicitly. These channels are not suitable for communication. The       aim of this is to detect covert channels. Machine learning technology can ingest and analyze statistics about       these rare domains. With the help of this information, security operations teams can work comfortably to       cloud the visibility of the attacker. Without a holistic view of the network they intend to attack, it becomes       tougher for cybercriminals to keep up their attacks moving forward along the kill chain.

A survey by YoungMinds, UK’s mental      health charity showed that 83% of the young people agreed that the      pandemic made their mental health worse.          The change in the mode of learning has a lot of impact on student’s      mental health. Online mode in spite of its advantages, has more      disadvantages as challenges are faced by both the students as well      as the instructors. All the social media and the OTT platforms are      just one tab away, which is quite near to get distracted. Not all the      homes can aid the learning environment. The amount the students      learn has shrunk a lot which makes them stress more about their      career. Another question is bothering the students as to “What will      happen?”.

Your career practically depends on the ATS:                                                     The ATS (Applicant Tracking System) is a machine that                                                   concludes for or against your resume in the selection process.                                                   You might have observed that the first thing companies want                                                   from you while they are recruiting is the resume.                                                   But do not fool yourself anticipating to get drawn in if you                                                   spurt the Tolstoy in you on your resume. The ATS works to                                                   select a resume that fits into the criteria of the company.                                                   So the most basic trick to get past the ATS is to stick to the                                                   keywords.

You cannot solely hope to get into the interviewers’ good         books by ruling out the need to pay an equal amount of         attention to all members taking the interview.         Everybody present in an interview has to be given equal         importance since they are there to judge you on different         aspects of attitude and the set of skills required to get a vote         of confidence.           Therefore you cannot single out a person impressing, whom         you think is going enough to get the job. Such an attitude         from an applicant will not be taken lightly and will         unanimously result in your elimination.          It is also necessary to make up the mind for some out of the         box questions in which proper reaction and emotional         balance play a big part than the correctness of answers, the         candidate must remember that a company will hire him         when they believe that he/she will be profitable and loyal to         the company, so candidate words should suggest that they         will be reliable to the company, At the same time bluffing the         interviewers with statements such as, the company is my         world would prove costly. Being clear about the job that he         wants and convincing description about how he can handle         that job if he gets it is some of the basic things to remember         while attending an interview.
